A simple calculator made with HTML and PHP

## Hey There
So this was one of my very first projects that I made in PHP. I learned a lot actually... It's very interesting. I'm kinda proud of it. It probably has some bugs and you can probably hack it, ah well.

Run it on a webserver: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
